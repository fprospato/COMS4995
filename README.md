I have a large background in mobile app development, espically iOS. I worked at Instagram this summer on iOS. With this in mind, I would like to focus on a iOS open source project to help out the community.

Project Ideas
1. Creating any type of calendar in an app is a long process. The only API they have is a scroller so for years developers either tried to build their own calendar or try open source projects (most are out dated or barely kept up). In iOS 14 they're giving developers a proper calendar but the UI and interaction is less than ideal. 

2. Enhance the experience of including Apple's Siri development. I've read that many developers are worried about the complexity of siri development. I would like to make a project that eases the process of incorporating Siri into any app. Would need to look more into this though to evaluate the complexity.

3.
